- 👋 Hi, I’m @allipski, nearly a fullstack developer!
- 👩‍🎓 I've graduated in business & hotel management in Australia, but also went to engineering college in Brazil.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, cats, gaming, barista coffe, entrepreneurship, nature and social/enviromental matters that can make the world a better place for everyone.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying to be a fullstack dev @DrivenEducation and get my career started in IT.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can make a difference in the world and in which I can make a difference for someone :)
